    <h1>Marian Reid</h1>

    I’m a writer and storyteller with a background in communication for non-government organisations (NGOs). I work globally with communities to tell stories that give voice to marginalised people and forgotten places. I’m interested in how people and the environment respond to extreme situations, and the place of culture in development.

   <h2>Communications</h2>

   As a Communication Specialist, I produce compelling content for NGOs that tell stories of need, hope and change. I spend time with women, men and children from all backgrounds and support them to tell their stories and be heard.

   I also facilitate storytelling workshops that draw on digital storytelling, the Photovoice method and participatory media.

    <h2>Creative</h2>

    <p>
    My creative work is informed by place, people and culture. I’m interested in tracing traditional practices in modern times, curious about the past life of buildings in strange places, and always seeking stories that shape the identity of a community.
